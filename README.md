## Overview
Skydiving technology has advanced considerably in recent years, vastly improving the safety of those who choose to fly. Despite these advancements, the sport of skydiving is still a dangerous one with significant risks. This repository is dedicated to utilizing engineering concepts to improve the ability, awareness, and safety of skydivers.

### Goals
* Reduce cost
* Reduce equipment size, weight
* Increase efficiency on the ground so more time can be spent in the sky
* Improve ground training through body flight simulations (non-tunnel)
* Advanced sensors to track detailed analytics of each jump, jumper (simulator play back)

### Idea Backlog
* alitimeter
* audible
* windspeed
* load clock
* HUD with telemetry, velocity, obstacle data
* body flight simulation (aerodynamics)
* point counter
* camera
* auto parachute packer
* AAD

## Hardware

## Software

## Tunnel
* Lights game
* Tunnel ball
* Battle
* Fight
* Team challenge
* Head-to-head
* Points tracking system 
* Skeletal positional tracking, computer vision
* Time trials
* Racing
*
