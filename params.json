{"name":"Skydive-tools","tagline":"A collection of ideas and prototypes for improving the sport of skydiving","body":"# skydive-tools\r\nSkydiving technology has advanced considerably in recent years, vastly improving the safety of those who choose to fly. Despite these advancements, the sport of skydiving is still a dangerous one with significant risks. This repository is dedicated to utilizing engineering concepts to improve the ability, awareness, and safety of skydivers.\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n* Reduce cost\r\n* Reduce equipment size, weight\r\n* Increase efficiency on the ground so more time can be spent in the sky\r\n* Improve ground training through body flight simulations (non-tunnel)\r\n* Advanced sensors to track detailed analytics of each jump, jumper (simulator play back)\r\n\r\n## Idea Backlog\r\n* alitimeter\r\n* audible\r\n* windspeed\r\n* load clock\r\n* HUD with telemetry, velocity, obstacle data\r\n* body flight simulation (aerodynamics)\r\n* point counter\r\n* camera\r\n* auto parachute packer\r\n* AAD\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
