## Reviews
- I can't really fault the Quattro for the price: if I wanted logging I would spring for the ProTrack. If I wanted swooping instead I'd go for the Optima II. If I wanted a spoken voice audible and money was no object I'd get the VOG. If I wanted cheap and simple there's the Brilliant Pebbles, no reason to get the Solo II anymore.
